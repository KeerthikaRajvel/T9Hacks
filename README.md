As Movie buffs, we were excited to work on this project to aggregate streaming platforms.

When we get recommendations from friends to watch a movie, we often find ourselves searching for it in different streaming applications. This platform is a one-stop shop that tells you where you can find a movie. We've also integrated a Twitter chatter which shows the most recent Tweets related to the movie, could be merch, or just things people are saying about the movie. We also provide details about the cast, IMDB ratings for the movie and a short description of the plot.
